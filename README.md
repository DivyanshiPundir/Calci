# Calculator
JavaScript Calculator
This project is a simple web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers basic arithmetic operations and additional functionalities like trigonometric functions and logarithms. The calculator has a clean and user-friendly interface designed using CSS.

# Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan.
Logarithmic Function: log base 10.
Exponential Function: x<sup>y</sup>.
Special Constants: π (Pi).
Brackets: Parentheses for grouping expressions.
Memory Functions: AC (All Clear) and DEL (Delete last character).
Decimal Support: Use of decimal points in calculations.
Percentage Calculation: % function.
Clear/Reset: Click AC to reset the calculator, or DEL to delete the last input character.


The calculator operates by capturing user input via the buttons and performing calculations based on JavaScript functions. Each button on the calculator is tied to a function in the index.js file that handles the respective operation. The display area dynamically updates to show the current input and results of the operations.

# JavaScript Functions
